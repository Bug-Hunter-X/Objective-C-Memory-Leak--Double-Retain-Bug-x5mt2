In Objective-C, a rare but impactful bug can occur due to the misuse of the `retain` and `release` methods in manual memory management.  Specifically, if an object is retained multiple times without a corresponding release for each retain, a memory leak occurs.  This is particularly tricky when dealing with complex object graphs or circular references.  For example:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, retain) MyClass *anotherObject;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    [anotherObject release];
    [super dealloc];
}

- (void)methodThatCausesLeak {
    MyClass *obj = [[MyClass alloc] init];
    self.anotherObject = obj; // Retains obj
    self.anotherObject = obj; // Retains obj AGAIN!  This is the leak!
    [obj release]; // Only releases once
}
@end
```

The `[obj release]` only counteracts one `retain`.  The extra retain in `self.anotherObject = obj;` is the source of the leak.
