The solution involves ensuring that for every `retain` call, there is a corresponding `release` call. The extra retain should be removed or balanced with an additional release.  Below is the corrected code:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, retain) MyClass *anotherObject;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    [anotherObject release];
    [super dealloc];
}

- (void)methodThatCausesLeak {
    MyClass *obj = [[MyClass alloc] init];
    self.anotherObject = obj; // Retains obj
    // Removed the extra retain: self.anotherObject = obj;
    [obj release]; // Now correctly releases the object
}
@end
```

Alternatively, using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) eliminates this class of errors entirely.  In modern Objective-C development, ARC is strongly recommended to avoid these kinds of memory management issues.
